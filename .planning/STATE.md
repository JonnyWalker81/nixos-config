## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase incremental build — GTD foundation first, then capture, agenda, org-roam, journal, visual, integration
- [Roadmap]: Strict directory separation — ~/org/gtd/ for agenda, ~/org/roam/ for org-roam, ~/org/journal/ for journal, ~/org/denote/ for denote
- [Roadmap]: Config split into config-org-gtd.el, config-org-roam.el, config-org-journal.el, config-org-visual.el

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Doom silently overrides capture templates and TODO states — must use `after! org` blocks (research pitfall #1, #2)
- [Phase 5]: org-roam symlink resolution fails on NixOS home-manager — needs `file-truename` workaround (research pitfall #3)
- [Phase 5]: Must verify `(sqlite-available-p)` returns t before org-roam setup — may need sqlite in NixOS system packages
